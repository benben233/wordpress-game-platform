    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I have built 4 different recommendation engines based on different ideas and algorithms. They are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Recommender:** This system used overall Vote Count and Vote Averages to build Top games Charts, in general and for a specific genre. The IMDB Weighted Rating System was used to calculate ratings on which the sorting was finally performed.\n",
    "2. **Content Based Recommender:** We built two content based engines; one that took game overview and taglines as input and the other which took metadata to come up with predictions. We also created a simple filter to give greater preference to games with more votes and higher ratings.\n",
    "3. **Collaborative Filtering:** We used the powerful Surprise Library to build a collaborative filter based on single value decomposition. The RMSE obtained was less than 1 and the engine gave estimated ratings for a given user and game.\n",
    "4. **Hybrid Engine:** We brought together ideas from content and collaborative filterting to build an engine that gave game suggestions to a particular user based on the estimated ratings that it had internally calculated for that user.\n"
